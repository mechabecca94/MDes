Public logs for my masters thesis project

# June 4 / 2018
This is where I am going to be keeping my public facing thesis documentation for my MDes project. I am aiming to use this log as a reflective journal of my progress, covering my thoughts both before and after making creative decisions. For now as I haven't started the game these logs are going to be more speculative, but my hope is that once I start programming I can also employ the GitHub method by Pippin, Jonathan, and Rilla to document my design decisions more closely.

Currently, I am planning my series of three participatory design workshops (awaiting ethics approval), while also compiling data I received from an anonymous online survey looking to get a better idea of stress perceptions. Those survey questions are as follows:

1. Age:	
2. Are you a university student?	
3. In one sentence, please describe what "stress" means to you personally:	
4. Please list a few key adjectives that describe your relationship to stress:	
5. What are some signs (physical and/or mental) that let you know you are feeling stressed?	
6. When you are stressed, do you tend to be more or less social than usual?  [Please pick one:]	
7. What is something that you do when you are feeling stressed to help cope with your feelings? 	
8. If a friend told you they were feeling stressed, what is something that you would do or say to help them out?	
9. Does technology in general connect to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, please describe:	
10. Has a videogame ever connected to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, how?
