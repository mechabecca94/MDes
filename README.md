Public logs for my masters thesis project

# June 15 / 2018
***DRAFT POST WIP***

This morning I finished my fifth thesis related consent meeting with a future participant, a process I have been busy with all this week. Each meeting has already been an incredible affirmation of the need to involve more than myself in designing for this topic of "stress." These meetings are proving that the meaning of stress isn't as medical for folks as the anonymous surveys might have indicated; something I had actually been a bit surprised to read, but for me it makes me wonder if perhaps we can aim to find a balance between physical and mental/emotional experiences.

Richness and depth of experiences that I am incredibley honored people are willing to share. I also want to maintain a space of safeness of participation

My brainstorming questions were things participants were also curious about; who am I designing this for? what format is it taking While some of these are things that I think will be determined through the co-designing, I also think that 

Storytelling - personal experiences, and human relationships to others -

That several of the participants are fairly experienced in game design, while others are complete begeinners. I think one strategy will be to propose severl "prompt" scaffolds - or let them run with their own. Have the two groups work on an idea? 

Brainstorming session - trying the Q/A system that I am also at the same time developing for the reflective game design group. 


Idea one - storytelling machine
Idea two - two giants looking after the village

This is where I am going to be keeping my public facing thesis documentation for my MDes project. I am aiming to use this log as a reflective journal of my progress, covering my thoughts both before and after making creative decisions. For now as I haven't started the game these logs are going to be more speculative, but my hope is that once I start programming I can also employ the GitHub method by Pippin, Jonathan, and Rilla to document my design decisions more closely.

Currently, I am planning my series of three participatory design workshops (awaiting ethics approval), while also compiling data I received from an anonymous online survey looking to get a better idea of stress perceptions. Those survey questions are as follows:

1. Age:	
2. Are you a university student?	
3. In one sentence, please describe what "stress" means to you personally:	
4. Please list a few key adjectives that describe your relationship to stress:	
5. What are some signs (physical and/or mental) that let you know you are feeling stressed?	
6. When you are stressed, do you tend to be more or less social than usual?  [Please pick one:]	
7. What is something that you do when you are feeling stressed to help cope with your feelings? 	
8. If a friend told you they were feeling stressed, what is something that you would do or say to help them out?	
9. Does technology in general connect to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, please describe:	
10. Has a videogame ever connected to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, how?
