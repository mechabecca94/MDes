<i> This entry is a repost that was first added to a private research group chat </i>

Hello all! I'm passing along the documentation from this and last week's diagram / card work. -  , because it might be hard for you to see on Hangouts, I also added the higher res pictures of the simple prototypes below. The "rules" plus my general design reflections on them are added in the actual diagram files.

Excited to get ideas from you folks soon!
