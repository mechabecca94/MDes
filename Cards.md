# 1.0 About

The Reflective Game Design card project is being developped as part of my research assistantship work with Dr. Rilla Khaled, and will be used as part of my Master of Design Research project.

In the last showing of the RGD cards, folks thought that the rules might be a bit tricky / overly complicated to navigate. Agreeing, I tried to do my own unguided "playthrough" of the cards, both physically and [digitally.](https://mechabecca.itch.io/brainstorming)

This excercise, in turn, led me to the idea for a game that embraced more of these questions then awnsers for my thesis subject of "stress"

I have done some more work on the game since Congress, and thanks to me wanting to familiarize myself with the laser cutter a bit more, made a (very rough) version of the game

I first created another iteration of the cards prototype, which involved branching out parallelograms and triangles to create a "map" of a reflective game.

Enric and I then had a very productive brainstorming and design session Thursday workshopping this, which raised a lot of good points about the intent and audience of the "game." We did an analysis exercise to try and think about who would be using this game, when they would be using it, and why - which helped us figure out if the game (as was) would be able to do all the things we wanted it to.

After this, we were able to come up with a modified version of my last prototype that would be mostly about questions over answers.

Since this meeting I switched gears to work on the presentation and haven't had a chance to try and make a ruleset or new card design for this Q>A game. However, I will be aiming to do a better write up / design mockup of this iteration soon.
