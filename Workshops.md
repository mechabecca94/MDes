# 1.0 About
The purpose of this research is to investigate the merits of using a participatory (more than one designer-based) methodology in the making of an original Reflective Game Design; an approach to game making that has the goal to design, deconstruct, and make sense of play experiences. My specific thematic interest is to generate reflection (or the educational reconsideration of some topic) through games around the ways and spaces that stress takes hold in our lives. During a series of three workshops I aim to foster a creative space for storytelling around stress and coping through the co-design and creation of analog (non-digital) game prototypes. Later, I will work to combine this collective information into a digital game prototype.

## 2.7 August 8 2018 pt. 2
Inspired by all the student brainstorming happening at critical hit, I'm going to try and come up with 100 game ideas by the end of this week. Some are likely to be only loosely described. However, I am aiming to commonly keep them be about <b>reflection on stress and coping</b>.

1. A gift giving game where players give "gifts" (empty boxes) to each other with prompts inside that ask each other what they can really give the other person.
2. A safety blanket making game where people sew in items, patches, or other items into blanket pouches to make a useable and "real-life" gamebed.
3. A reverse the clock game where people spin back a giant watch hour by hour, 24 times, to review the day's stresses and comforts.
4. A game where two people make a doll house and write associations on the furniture and people inside, trying to each come up with comparable words between their respective houses.
5. An image making game where people have to make a tile mosaic of the other person's portrait, but only with pieces that get whispered a piece of wisdom from the other player first.
6. An rpg where you help a sad ghost.
7. An alchemy game where one player tries to transmute the other's stress into base stressor elements.
8. A game that uses a pond, stones, and coins to make a stress wishing well - except wishing stress away, you wish for one positive thing you would believe for yourself.
9. A game where you help the kittens who lost their mittens to cope with that loss. 
10. A game where you make a misfit toy.
11. A game of miniature un-twister where you massage out the knots in the wooden mannequin's stressed out backs.

## 2.6 August 8 2018 pt. 1
Due to some unfortunate life events, I've both been inspired and hindered from working on these thesis logs for several weeks. First, inspiration: thinking about what remains - what is comforting - after the extraneous elements of our lives, stuff, and everything else fades into the background and we focus on dealing with our stress. Second, the unfortunate: the revelations have come after being hounded by bedbugs in my new apartment. While mild in comparison to what some new homeowners need to face, the experience of throwing out many of one's belongings, of being decentralized from one's living area, is an extremely tense and unpleasant one. So much of our most private identity and habits are tied to where we live and sleep, and holding onto that sense of internal strength has been at times difficult recently in the face of overwhelming emotions and uncertainty about this space. What has been comforting, much I think like what the participants understood and recognized in their works, is the companionship found in a community of friends and loved ones. 

While I am still not sure how I will care for the specific project ideas that were started in the workshops, I want to stay true to what the core design goal of these individual projects are - expression, companionship, growth, comfort. At the same time that I am revisiting the data produced from these sessions, I am thinking about how I will make the design process as transparent as possible on my end. Live streaming work sessions, office hours, and other physical public access options are things that have been considered. However, this will likely also depend on what kind of making ends up happening.

In review of the presentation from last session:

1. I started the session answering a few copyright questions folks had asked me after the first workshop, clarifying that I will be using an open creative commons licence on any works made. This means that the games will be open for anyone (including participants to use) after they are finished, as long as credit is given. 

2. On the note of credits, it was mentioned that if someone wants to have their name associated with these creative works (and not the research - they will stay anonymous for that )I asked them to fill a "credits sheet."

2. We reviewed our photo studies, noting that many people found time (and the associated worries we have with it) stressful. Some other folks made great observations about their physical stress symptoms, and some others still captured examples of positive things they did to cope (like playing games or reading).

3. We briefly revisited our own game rules and values to catch some of our new faces up to speed.

4. I then did a brief review of paper prototyping; specifically, outlining why it is a useful (cheap/fast/straightforward) design method. I likewise mentioned how it can help us think about our game's flow, balance (or imbalance), and other critical play elements.

5. Folks then took the last hour to develop their ideas further, creating a draft ruleset and descriptions that will be used for wrapping up our prototypes next week, where we will also share our final progress between teams.

6. Once I've had a chance to review all the documentation, I will send any photos of individual participants to those particular people.

Verbal summary of the workshop 1 slides here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q6lJXk8_cQ8v7g1IMGIROAgRdq0I-ELCDcA-Q6p5Cro/edit?usp=sharing

- I first led the session with a quick introduction of myself and my research interests, which generally revolve around using games and playful interventions for wellness/positive social impact.
- We then did some short introductions around the room before I talked about Reflective Game Design, and why this approach to making can be interesting for making educational experiences that help us to design, deconstruct, and make sense of play experiences. I shared the four tenants of Reflective Game Design, which are questions over answers, clarity over stealth, disruption over comfort, and reflection over immersion.
- I then gave an example of a Reflective Game called “Cook Your Way” (which has an online public development log here if anyone is curious to read more: https://github.com/enricllagostera/rgd/blob/master/logs.md).
- I shared how research-creation lets us understand a design from the beginning to the end of a project, and also why participatory design is interesting because if contrasts with some potentially limiting approaches to design (like "user" centred design).
- Stress was talked about as being a focus because of its universal, but unique nature; it is something that we all experience, but our interpretations (which are very much related to intersectional / lived experiences) are different. 
- Design guidelines were given for a social game "helping people cope with stress."
- Some game development hints were given, like using verbs as rules and thinking about values as design pillars. 
- We then did a value highlighting exercise, where folks first filled out a sheet with values they had personally wanted for the game, before the groups worked together to create a collective value sheet.
- These values then helped to direct the next hour of ideation time, where I asked folks to determine a logline, mechanics and rules, and set of pillars for their games.
- Team A described an active game about taking turns releasing (writing/drawing/singing) stress, in a kind of cross between the creative expression of pictionary and the choices afforded by truth or dare. Players use an object passed around the group (for now, “the pause cow,” named after a plastic cow figurine) as a talking tool, so that others without the object need to pause and pay attention silently to the holder. Values for this game are simplicity, emotional safety, and empathy. Ultimately, the game hopes to act as a positive loop that makes the players feel increasingly comfortable in expressing stress with others. 
- Team B described “a game where your stress is your individual game board,” where players draw representations of their stress in order to create their own game map. The drawings (through size, color, shape etc.) will be given different “weights” and meanings per coded dice, meaning rules which will perhaps also be aided by storytelling prompts  / accrued tokens. Critically, all players must work together in order to “leave” this stress map. Pillars for this game are cooperative stress management, being “a dash of art therapy’, community, lived experience, commiseration & support, being personal/personalized, stress relief, and disruption.

## 2.3 June 27 2018 pt. 1

Yesterday was the first workshop, huzzah! Things went really rather smoothly and I'm super excited with what was produced. To backtrack and touch on some of my notes from last time, I ended up deciding to not give the groups a direct scaffold, but rather to give some general "design guidelines" to work with. Those involved the prompt, "helping people cope with stress," and making a social game (the latter of which came from my stress research and social coping skills). These went over quite well and people seemed to like the balance of structure with creative freedom.

As for the running of the workshop itself, I found myself occupying a kind of hands off / occasional pop-in role once the more formal presentation element was over with. That is to say, folks were generally good to work on the game ideas themselves, although I would sometimes pop in to a conversation I could hear was struggling in order to suggest some potential directions. At one point I shared a deck of positive stress coping / stress symptom cards with folks to try and solve a roadblock; at another  I redirected folks back to the "stress roadmap" to try and ground the conversation towards some theory. I think because I kept this lighter (participatory!) approach, there was a sense of helping vs. telling (what I didn't want). In the end, two groups of four and three respectively came up with fantastic game ideas that focus on stress coping. I'll write up some more about those ideas once I've finished documenting things, but for now, one observation I want to keep is that gently suggesting some research as roadblock shifter seemed to spur reflective thought.

## 2.2 June 15 2018

This morning I finished my fifth thesis related consent meeting with a future participant, a process I have been busy with all this week. Each meeting has already been an incredible affirmation of the need to involve more than myself in designing for this topic of "stress." These meetings are proving that the meaning of stress isn't as medical for folks as the anonymous surveys might have indicated; something I had actually been a bit surprised to read, but for me it makes me wonder if perhaps we can aim to find a balance between physical and mental/emotional experiences.

Some quick observations:
- I am seeing a richness and depth of experiences that I am incredibley honored people are willing to share;
- I also want to maintain a space of safeness of participation;
- My brainstorming questions were things participants were also curious about; who am I designing this for? what format is it taking? 
- While some of these are things that I think will be determined through the co-designing, I also think that storytelling - personal experiences, and human relationships to others - will be critical elements of our discussions.
- Several of the participants are fairly experienced in game design, while others are complete begeinners. I think one strategy will be to propose several "prompt" scaffolds... or maybe have the two groups work on an idea?

## 2.1 June 4 2018
This is where I am going to be keeping my public facing thesis documentation for my MDes project. I am aiming to use this log as a reflective journal of my progress, covering my thoughts both before and after making creative decisions. For now as I haven't started the game these logs are going to be more speculative, but my hope is that once I start programming I can also employ the GitHub method by Pippin, Jonathan, and Rilla to document my design decisions more closely.

Currently, I am planning my series of three participatory design workshops (awaiting ethics approval), while also compiling data I received from an anonymous online survey looking to get a better idea of stress perceptions. Those survey questions are as follows:

1. Age:	
2. Are you a university student?	
3. In one sentence, please describe what "stress" means to you personally:	
4. Please list a few key adjectives that describe your relationship to stress:	
5. What are some signs (physical and/or mental) that let you know you are feeling stressed?	
6. When you are stressed, do you tend to be more or less social than usual?  [Please pick one:]	
7. What is something that you do when you are feeling stressed to help cope with your feelings? 	
8. If a friend told you they were feeling stressed, what is something that you would do or say to help them out?	
9. Does technology in general connect to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, please describe:	
10. Has a videogame ever connected to your relationship with stress, either positively or negatively? If so, how?
