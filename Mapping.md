# 1.0 About

The Reflective Game Design mapping project is being developped as part of my research assistantship work with Dr. Rilla Khaled.

Today and yesterday while working to refamiliarize myself with this cards/ mapping project, I decided to look a bit deeper at 
what else is out there for mapping type softwares. I ended up encountering the idea of "issue based information systems" (courtesy of Rittel and his wicked problems), as well as a more general "problem structuring methods." I think that these concepts could be pretty important for making a backbone to our own mapping project, and it was quite striking the similarities that had been emergent between my first card based attempt at mapping a sense making space and the one that was established by Rittel. 

As well, I've also made a design <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWyeBUYF3YND7JaOFPt-CEMhwCl0UU1ghsr1PaMtlmY/edit#">document</a> to consolodate this research a bit better. For now, what seems most interesting to me inderesting for this project is that we could offer a tacticle or physical means of engaging with this problem space that also translates to the digital (which seems to be what currently is out there).

In the last showing of the RGD cards, folks thought that the rules might be a bit tricky / overly complicated to navigate. Agreeing, I tried to do my own unguided "playthrough" of the cards, both physically and [digitally.](https://mechabecca.itch.io/brainstorming)

This excercise, in turn, led me to the idea for a game that embraced more of these questions then awnsers for my thesis subject of "stress"

Next, I will be trying to take the prompts I gave myself during this excercise ("why"? the dichotemies, etc.) and turning them into something a bit more standard/straightforward for others to try. Rilla had the suggestion of separating the kinds of prompts into different categories, i.e., questions that could always be generative vs. narrowing. This I will try before our next research meeting!

I have done some more work on the game since Congress, and thanks to me wanting to familiarize myself with the laser cutter a bit more, made a (very rough) version of the game

I first created another iteration of the cards prototype, which involved branching out parallelograms and triangles to create a "map" of a reflective game.

Enric and I then had a very productive brainstorming and design session Thursday workshopping this, which raised a lot of good points about the intent and audience of the "game." We did an analysis exercise to try and think about who would be using this game, when they would be using it, and why - which helped us figure out if the game (as was) would be able to do all the things we wanted it to.

After this, we were able to come up with a modified version of my last prototype that would be mostly about questions over answers.

Since this meeting I switched gears to work on the presentation and haven't had a chance to try and make a ruleset or new card design for this Q>A game. However, I will be aiming to do a better write up / design mockup of this iteration soon.
