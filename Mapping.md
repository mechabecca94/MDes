# 1.0 About

The Reflective Game Design mapping project is being developped as part of my research assistantship work with Dr. Rilla Khaled.

Using the feedback written about in the last post, Rilla and I worked during the Global Game Jam 2019 to document participant responses using the tool. We recruited eighteen people in game making groups of various sizes to try the tool before the jam got too far underway, so that we could see how the team dynamics started and how the idea was originally conceived. We also sent out a post jam survey, asking about how the tool was perceived, and also how the participants self rated the "reflective" attributes of their games.

The early short abstract of this project has been accepted to DiGRA Kyoto 2019, and so I'm currently working to further elaborate on our data collection and analysis methods per the recommendation of one of the reviewers.

Wow, a while since the last update! Fortunately things are not broken and in fact are doing quite well with the project I think. First, the bug that was breaking the game was found – it had to do with a fade-in animation breaking Twine, so I asked a friend to help me rewrite that out of there. Second, I sent the now fixed version to a couple of folks last week and got some awesome feedback that in summary mostly said:
-	People didn’t think the character limit was long enough (was 100, is now 280/Tweet size)
-	Some of the wording was confusing on the questions
-	The framing of the exercise (“what is reflection?”) was a bit vague  

I’ve fixed these and other issues in the most recent version as screenshotted below. With this we should be good to go for our big research test at the Global Game Jam 2019. I’m excited to see how player ideas develop between using the tool and their end project!

oops... I broke something while updating the graphics :(. Gonna try to fix tomorrow, I know the error is happening with variables somehow becoming "undefined"... 

## 11. Dec 6 2018
It's been a while since my last update, but I think things are making some pretty good progress on the project. Much of my focus has been on co-writing a chapter proposal with Rilla and figuring out the details for a more formal research study with the map tool. On the software end, a few things have been updated, namely an expanded question bank with eight questions instead of four for each category. During this process of writing new potentially reflective questions I found myself moving some questions into different categories that on this read seemed to fit better. I am not sure if that is because I hadn’t clearly defined the questions at the beginning of the game last time, but I hope that this restructuring clears up some of the ambiguity about why these questions are being asked.

## 10. Nov 15 2018
I did an informal playtesting of the game with a friend yesterday and he had some good feedback for me. He definitely felt that the concept of moving through an idea in this step by step way was useful, but that (as was) it felt a bit too rushed. His suggestion was to break apart the introduction so that the context of what was happening was clear, and also to add more rounds of questioning. I quite agree with both of these so in addition to trying to get it to export to a spreadsheet I want to work on these elaborating features next.

It doesn't look like much yet but a wip twine version of the game...
Hoping to get the loop done tomorrow

<b>Research</b>  
This week I've been looking per Rilla's suggestion into creativity. Most of the literature I looked at was interested in the psychological causes of creativity and ways to quantitatively describe it. However, one method called the ["Six Thinking Hats"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_07.htm) technique proved useful for thinking about question addressing though different lenses. 

Members of a team are asked to adopt one of six colored hats, with each color representing a different way of thinking that the person needs to adopt (even if this mode of analysis is outside their usual comfort zone). For example, if I was participating on a project I was worried about, the "yellow" hat would ask me to also try and see some positives of the situation. This makes the method a bit unlike the IBIS system, with more room for emotion intended to be in the hats tool itself vs. a complete focus on logic in IBIS. 

<b>Prototyping</b>  
As for my prototyping, I started by using the seven question types to come up with a series of questions that related to games and reflective games in general. These groups of questions were then assigned icons. Each kind of question got its own icon except for deontic and instrumental thinking, which share a gear icon. Unlike “regular” problem solving we are more interested in asking provocative questions, so I wanted to consolidate the “clear cut” ways of addressing a problem a bit more.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WLoZuEt.jpg?4)

The above is my first play through of a system that involves first writing down my game idea to be questioned for reflective reconsideration. I will break down the steps I took in a tidied up recreation below.

<b>Prototype rules</b>  

1.	First I have my materials: 5 categories of question cards, paper clips, a marker, and the mapping board.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z2b1V2y.jpg)

2. I fold the board along the dashed lines  

![](https://i.imgur.com/9LZexze.jpg)

3. I start by writing my game idea or description in the box with a "1"  

![](https://i.imgur.com/P1k5bq3.jpg)

4. I then fold the paper from the top down so that when unfolded, the "1" will be the last thing revealed, and I leave the bottom "2" square showing.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/RQNODeZ.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/hSymCem.jpg?1)

5. I then use my dice to pick a question category; a normal dice could work too, but I just made a quick one on a wooden block  

![](https://i.imgur.com/DVObkw5.jpg?1)

6. I respond to this question in the "2" block, pinning the question to the side. I continue to roll the dice and answering questions one unfold at a time until I get to the question below my original idea  

![](https://i.imgur.com/yotdEVD.jpg?1)
![](https://i.imgur.com/DMIhIGz.jpg?1)

8. When I unfold this last spot, I reframe my original idea in light of the answered questions.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/sTT9eLY.jpg)

So, in this test I went from writing "a game about trees fighting to save the planet" to "using the (fictional) story of trees in the Hambach forest and befriended activists as an allegory for broader climate change (social concerns)."  

<b>Notes</b>  
I'd like to try and see how other rulesets could apply to these same or similar materials; maybe you cut out your responses from the map, maybe you have someone else fill out the other side of the map, etc. As well, I think a big next step will be continuing to develop a bank of reflective questions.

<b>Research</b>

This week I’ve been doing a lot of research about problem mapping methods and sense making. One tool that has come up and I think is particularly relevant for the two key tasks we want to do - study reflective debrief, and help developers to design reflective experiences - is the research practice of Dialogue Mapping. Dialogue mapping uses a notation system (IBIS) that consists of questions, pros, cons, and ideas to give “a container large enough and rich enough to hold the multithreaded conversations” that happen in a “wicked” design project (Conklin, 2006, xi). As opposed to some other systems of mapping, there is a directionality to the information (arrows going right to left, always pointing back to the main question) and a primary rootedness in questions as opposed to solutions. 

![](https://pictureitsolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DMElementsStructure.png)
<i>Image from https://pictureitsolved.com/resources/practices/dialogue-mapping/</i>

Dialogue mapping can become intimidating with all of its branches, but it does help to create a more logical depiction of a question scenario. For example, like I was trying to do way back with the reflective 2D graphics, IBIS and Dialogue Mapping try to use relations to make sense of the branching areas of concern that come with complex problems: “the more novel the problem, the more the problem-solving process involves learning about the problem domain. (p.12).” 
As well, mapping as a group activity helps to create shared understanding and commitment to a decision by laying out all the foreseeable options (even if some are imperfect or still question raising) at play (p.42). 

<b>For our project</b>

Though mostly intended for group problems,  I think we can promote reflection by having the independent designer “question in the shoes” of their audience. What I mean by that is, the kinds of questions the tool asks will have to prompt thinking from a perspective external to the person using it, as if the game itself were the group in regular Dialogue Mapping. Because “IBIS and dialogue mapping are very helpful in the exploratory phase of problem solving,” I think it makes sense to at least consider a kind of notation based system for our own project (p.204). I had tried something much simpler before in fact with the “question” tiles, detailed in posts below.

On the note of questions, this cited text is also great for learning about rhetoric and logic generally. It proposes (with reference to Rittel, 1970) that there are seven general types of questions. The two most common for a root question on a dialogue map are 

1. “deontic” (what should we do) and 
2. “instrumental” (how should we do it). 

The other five types of questions are: 

3. “critical” (what are the criteria for these goals?), 
4. “meaning” or “conceptual” (what does X mean in my question?),
5. “factual” (what is X, as validated by external facts or sources?)
6. “background” (what is the background to this project?)   
7. “stakeholder” (who are the stakeholders to this project?)

Given that all of this would be a lot of information to throw at a reflective game designer (with Conklin also suggesting it isn’t explicitly needed to break down question types in a session), I will be working in the next week to create an abbreviated kind of question bank that applies this research when relevant to Rilla’s reflective work. 

Finally, it is still proving tricky to make the tool to be as detailed as we need without being too complex to play. Tiles or cards could maybe help the game be accessible, but that limits what we can do in terms of information recording; a stamp or pin based system could let someone write on a page, but then it becomes difficult to “limit” the game's sprawl. One idea I haven’t tried yet is to maybe recommend a limited number of question turns vs. the way of recording general information, kind of similar to a different problem solving tool called the “5 Why’s.”

<b>Next steps</b>

- Have a proper question bank drafted;
- Have rules drafted even if the tool form isn’t done;
- Continue to do experiments in a physical interface;
- Continue to look into creativity tools for inspiration and literary reference.

## 5. Oct 19 2018

Today and yesterday while working to refamiliarize myself with this cards/ mapping project, I decided to look a bit deeper at 
what else is out there for mapping type softwares. I ended up encountering the idea of "issue based information systems" (courtesy of Rittel and his wicked problems), as well as a more general "problem structuring methods." I think that these concepts could be pretty important for making a backbone to our own mapping project, and it was quite striking the similarities that had been emergent between my first card based attempt at mapping a sense making space and the one that was established by Rittel. 

As well, I've also made a design <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWyeBUYF3YND7JaOFPt-CEMhwCl0UU1ghsr1PaMtlmY/edit#">document</a> to consolodate this research a bit better. For now, what seems most interesting to me inderesting for this project is that we could offer a tacticle or physical means of engaging with this problem space that also translates to the digital (which seems to be what currently is out there).

## 4. July 3 2018

In the last showing of the RGD cards, folks thought that the rules might be a bit tricky / overly complicated to navigate. Agreeing, I tried to do my own unguided "playthrough" of the cards, both physically and [digitally.](https://mechabecca.itch.io/brainstorming)

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/b6yUnWL.jpg)  

![](https://i.imgur.com/wLgvF42.png)  

This excercise, in turn, led me to the idea for a game that embraced more of these questions then awnsers for my thesis subject of "stress"

![](https://i.imgur.com/BPDFXFQ.png)

Next, I will be trying to take the prompts I gave myself during this excercise ("why"? the dichotemies, etc.) and turning them into something a bit more standard/straightforward for others to try. Rilla had the suggestion of separating the kinds of prompts into different categories, i.e., questions that could always be generative vs. narrowing. This I will try before our next research meeting!

I have done some more work on the game since Congress, and thanks to me wanting to familiarize myself with the laser cutter a bit more, made a (very rough) version of the game

I first created another iteration of the cards prototype, which involved branching out parallelograms and triangles to create a "map" of a reflective game. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/XS9Tuzb.jpg)

Enric and I then had a very productive brainstorming and design session Thursday workshopping this, which raised a lot of good points about the intent and audience of the "game." We did an analysis exercise to try and think about who would be using this game, when they would be using it, and why - which helped us figure out if the game (as was) would be able to do all the things we wanted it to. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/kWOsb2g.jpg)

After this, we were able to come up with a modified version of my last prototype that would be mostly about questions over answers.

![](https://i.imgur.com/r9xB3Qn.jpg)

Since this meeting I switched gears to work on the presentation and haven't had a chance to try and make a ruleset or new card design for this Q>A game. However, I will be aiming to do a better write up / design mockup of this iteration soon.
