# 1.0 About

The Reflective Game Design mapping project is being developped as part of my research assistantship work with Dr. Rilla Khaled.

<b>Research</b>

This week I’ve been doing a lot of research about problem mapping methods and sense making. One tool that has come up and I think is particularly relevant for the two key tasks we want to do - study reflective debrief, and help developers to design reflective experiences - is the research practice of Dialogue Mapping. Dialogue mapping uses a notation system (IBIS) that consists of questions, pros, cons, and ideas to give “a container large enough and rich enough to hold the multithreaded conversations” that happen in a “wicked” design project (Conklin, 2006, xi). As opposed to some other systems of mapping, there is a directionality to the information (arrows going right to left, always pointing back to the main question) and a primary rootedness in questions as opposed to solutions.

Dialogue mapping can become intimidating with all of its branches, but it does help to create a more logical depiction of a question scenario. For example, like I was trying to do way back with the reflective 2D graphics, IBIS and Dialogue Mapping try to use relations to make sense of the branching areas of concern that come with complex problems: “the more novel the problem, the more the problem-solving process involves learning about the problem domain. (p.12).” 
As well, mapping as a group activity helps to create shared understanding and commitment to a decision by laying out all the foreseeable options (even if some are imperfect or still question raising) at play (p.42). 

<b>For our project</b>

Though mostly intended for group problems,  I think we can promote reflection by having the independent designer “question in the shoes” of their audience. What I mean by that is, the kinds of questions the tool asks will have to prompt thinking from a perspective external to the person using it, as if the game itself were the group in regular Dialogue Mapping. Because “IBIS and dialogue mapping are very helpful in the exploratory phase of problem solving,” I think it makes sense to at least consider a kind of notation based system for our own project (p.204). I had tried something much simpler before in fact with the “question” tiles, detailed in posts below.

On the note of questions, this cited text is also great for learning about rhetoric and logic generally. It proposes (with reference to Rittel, 1970) that there are seven general types of questions. The two most common for a root question on a dialogue map are 

1. “deontic” (what should we do) and 
2. “instrumental” (how should we do it). 

The other five types of questions are: 

3. “critical” (what are the criteria for these goals?), 
4. “meaning” or “conceptual” (what does X mean in my question?),
5. “factual” (what is X, as validated by external facts or sources?)
6. “background” (what is the background to this project?)   
7. “stakeholder” (who are the stakeholders to this project?)

Given that all of this would be a lot of information to throw at a reflective game designer (with Conklin also suggesting it isn’t explicitly needed to break down question types in a session), I will be working in the next week to create an abbreviated kind of question bank that applies this research when relevant to Rilla’s reflective work. 

Finally, it is still proving tricky to make the tool to be as detailed as we need without being too complex to play. Tiles or cards could maybe help the game be accessible, but that limits what we can do in terms of information recording; a stamp or pin based system could let someone write on a page, but then it becomes difficult to “limit” the game. One idea I haven’t tried yet is to maybe limit the number of question turns vs. the way of recording general information, kind of similar to a different problem solving tool called the “5 Why’s.”

<b>Next steps</b>

- Have a proper question bank drafted;
- Have rules drafted even if the tool form isn’t done;
- Continue to do experiments in a physical interface;
- Continue to look into creativity tools for inspiration and literary reference.

## 2.5 Oct 19 2018

Today and yesterday while working to refamiliarize myself with this cards/ mapping project, I decided to look a bit deeper at 
what else is out there for mapping type softwares. I ended up encountering the idea of "issue based information systems" (courtesy of Rittel and his wicked problems), as well as a more general "problem structuring methods." I think that these concepts could be pretty important for making a backbone to our own mapping project, and it was quite striking the similarities that had been emergent between my first card based attempt at mapping a sense making space and the one that was established by Rittel. 

As well, I've also made a design <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWyeBUYF3YND7JaOFPt-CEMhwCl0UU1ghsr1PaMtlmY/edit#">document</a> to consolodate this research a bit better. For now, what seems most interesting to me inderesting for this project is that we could offer a tacticle or physical means of engaging with this problem space that also translates to the digital (which seems to be what currently is out there).

In the last showing of the RGD cards, folks thought that the rules might be a bit tricky / overly complicated to navigate. Agreeing, I tried to do my own unguided "playthrough" of the cards, both physically and [digitally.](https://mechabecca.itch.io/brainstorming)

This excercise, in turn, led me to the idea for a game that embraced more of these questions then awnsers for my thesis subject of "stress"

Next, I will be trying to take the prompts I gave myself during this excercise ("why"? the dichotemies, etc.) and turning them into something a bit more standard/straightforward for others to try. Rilla had the suggestion of separating the kinds of prompts into different categories, i.e., questions that could always be generative vs. narrowing. This I will try before our next research meeting!

## 2.3 June 5 2018

I have done some more work on the game since Congress, and thanks to me wanting to familiarize myself with the laser cutter a bit more, made a (very rough) version of the game

I first created another iteration of the cards prototype, which involved branching out parallelograms and triangles to create a "map" of a reflective game.

Enric and I then had a very productive brainstorming and design session Thursday workshopping this, which raised a lot of good points about the intent and audience of the "game." We did an analysis exercise to try and think about who would be using this game, when they would be using it, and why - which helped us figure out if the game (as was) would be able to do all the things we wanted it to.

After this, we were able to come up with a modified version of my last prototype that would be mostly about questions over answers.

Since this meeting I switched gears to work on the presentation and haven't had a chance to try and make a ruleset or new card design for this Q>A game. However, I will be aiming to do a better write up / design mockup of this iteration soon.
