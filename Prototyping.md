## 2.4 November 4 2018
Quite a few developments have happened on the project lately, and I think I've finally started to move into a general gameplay loop that is one I will want to be playtesting.  

<b>Theory</b>
First, in terms of literature and reading, I have been assembling a preliminary group of references based around key themes that I (re) brainstormed as relating to my project.

While I haven't had the chance to view the other MDes student theses yet and how they structure their ideas, I think that getting clear what I mean by my core ideas and associated concepts will go a long way in contextualizing the project.

<b>Prototyping</b>
For prototyping, my first major effort was to create a fuller fleshed "mapping" game. It relied heavily on the "NUTS" model of stress, using each corner of a modified North-South-East-West map to represent one of stress's attributes per this paradigm. Players then worked to first map their own stress on a miniature  NUTS map, before working to find each other on a bigger map.

While I really liked the idea of mapping stress broadly as a means of problem orientation and reframing, after conversing with others about this idea a few design tradeoffs and limitations started to emerge. In talking with Enric about the work, he wondered why players had their own maps as opposed to working on a big one - something that I tend to agree with in retrospect. Also, limiting the lens with which to read stress to only the “NUTS” system felt like it was leaving out other options and means of coping.

This led me to create the current working idea, which (in theory) has a complete game loop, as follows...

<b>The game</b>
![](https://i.imgur.com/ULqeHHM.jpg?1)  
<i>It involves a gameboard, drawing pieces, prompts, & questions and coping tokens.  
The goal of the game is to describe one's stress, possible coping mechanisms, and a reframing of the stress with these ideas in mind. To achieve this, players must move from the outside to the inside of the board through both individual and collective action.</i>

1. At the beginning of the game everyone is given one coping token to start. However, they cannot apply it right away; that is because they must always have at least one extra token in hand. Being depleted of our ability to cope will leave us too drained. It will come in use later if people want to switch coping skills.  

2. A prompt card is chosen to go into the centre of the board. If none of the provided prompts are useful, then the group can come up with their own prompt instead.

3. Everyone responds to the prompt individually by drawing on their drawing piece. This is placed in one of the board's "petals," and this is where the player is to start their movement towards the centre of the board.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/TCRmhN0.jpg)  

4. The last person to finish their drawing takes out another coping token from the bag and reads the associated coping color prompt. If this is something they can apply to the stress, then they add the token to their petal's middle bridge and keep the card for later. However, they may (after drawing a token but before reading the card) choose to try their own beginning coping skill out instead. They similarly read a prompt, keeping for later if used, and if not discarding the card to the bottom of the pile.

5. If the skill wasn't useful, they may offer to share the skill, giving the token to another player who finds it helpful. Otherwise, the unused token is kept for later and any cards placed to the bottom of the appropriate pile.

6. This continues around the table until all players are able to get one of each type of coping color.

7. When someone does get one of each coping color, they are able to move their drawing piece into the other side of their petal, flipping it over to the blank side for now.

8. Players who have retrieved one of each coping token color continue to help others by drawing coping mechanisms and offering support, until everyone has their drawings moved forward into the other petal half.

9. When everyone is here, gameplay pauses for people to redraw their stress, this time in consideration of the acquired coping skills and gameplay discussions had.

10. When finished, players go around the table placing their reframed drawing face up into the middle of the board, similarly sharing any final thoughts or sentiments before the end of the game.

<b>Next steps</b>  
- Smoothing out how drawing cards, tokens, and sharing of prompts works;
- Figuring out how to group categories of coping;
- Informally trying the work before playtest 1;
- Laser cutting the board and other materials;
- General preparation for the playtest.

## 2.3 October 5 2018
Lately I have been doing a lot of [paper based idea generation and prototyping](https://imgur.com/a/XgsZRgr), rather than jumping into a game engine and starting to fiddle with things directly. Likewise, I've created a working game design document that is still being edited but is trying to convert my game design goals to playable mechanics.

As you can see, I've played with a lot of different concepts about getting people to reconsider through reflection their perceptions of stress, from alternate tea pot controllers to unusual "lost mitten" story perspectives. 

However, this last pictured idea is probably the one I am thinking about the most because it is compatible both with reflective game design and my participant's proposed tenants. It is a game that <b>deconstructs</b> stresses in relation to their factors before players <b>reconstruct</b> them into their lives. During this first phase, players describe their stresses and assign them to some sort of token, likely through writing and/or drawing. These stress token are then "mapped" to a board that has "NUTS" (Novelty, Uncertainty, Threat to the ego, and Sense of control) at its four corners, almost like boats on an ocean of four intermingling seas. The stress tokens are placed in relation to where participants feel they are most weighted, so that when multiple stresses are described, they can be generally visualized in the context of one's life (center of the board) and one's difficulties. For example, in my own demo, I had time drawn as a clock on one token (the pink one) that I placed in between uncertainty and novelty.

The next (reconstructive) part of gameplay is still unclear, but for one iteration I’m almost thinking of some kind of anti-battleship where rather than have players shoot each other in an unseen map, they try to find one another's stress points and help them with coping and commiseration. Another modification of a "reconstruction" process which I tried in the photo is to have coping skill or positive affirmation tokens act as "bridges" between the stress points and one's life, with the goal being to move all of one's stresses into the center for a holistic life-stress integration.

In terms of medium, I am really being drawn to something physical, that affords for players to be able to draw and write on the play space (much like what group b did in their design). In my personal journey with stress and anxiety management I find that one of the most assured ways to help me focus is through the drawing and making of art. I’ve looked a bit into conductive paint as a potential way of connecting tokens or coping skills, but it certainly has its challenges (messy, only comes in black, etc.) It’s not to say that I don’t ever want to include screens, but I think for the purposes of a December playtest it is definitely going to be more productive to get an analog game down first.

Rilla in our last meeting did bring up a good point about some of my ideas, which was a question about what separated them from being a "game" vs a "playful experience". I definitely don't want to be gamifying anything for the sake of gamification only, so it's going to be important to make sure that my name design is a <i>reflective</i> game design.

Finally, one thing that I've been considering as part of this program is how the final work will be displayed in an exhibition / public facing gallery. Although I think it would be great to try and play the game in person, I'm not sure that this will be something which I can do given the display will be up for at least a week on its own. It could be cool to schedule evening play sessions on certain days, but for now I'm going to emphasize the project and its participatory for through video and photo documentation.

## 2.2 August 8 2018 pt. 2
Inspired by all the student brainstorming happening at critical hit, I'm going to try and come up with <s>100</s> <s>50</s> 20 game ideas by the end of this week. Some are likely to be only loosely described. However, I am aiming to commonly keep them be about <b>reflection on stress and coping</b>.

1. A gift giving game where players give "gifts" (empty boxes) to each other with prompts inside that ask each other what they can really give the other person.
2. A safety blanket making game where people sew in items, patches, or other items into blanket pouches to make a useable and "real-life" gamebed.
3. A reverse the clock game where people spin back a giant watch hour by hour, 24 times, to review the day's stresses and comforts.
4. A game where two people make a doll house and write associations on the furniture and people inside, trying to each come up with comparable words between their respective houses.
5. An image making game where people have to make a tile mosaic of the other person's portrait, but only with pieces that get whispered a piece of wisdom from the other player first.
6. An rpg where you help a sad ghost.
7. An alchemy game where one player tries to transmute the other's stress into base stressor elements.
8. A game that uses a pond, stones, and coins to make a stress wishing well - except wishing stress away, you wish for one positive thing you would believe for yourself.
9. A game where you help the kittens who lost their mittens to cope with that loss. 
10. A game where you make a misfit toy.
11. A game of miniature un-twister where you massage out the knots in the wooden mannequin's stressed out backs.
12. A game where one person puts pins in the Pincushion of Stress™ and another person pulls them out.
13. A game where closing your eyes in real life stops the gameplay, so you can take a break to reflect if you want.
14. A game about two retired adventurers who are recounting all of the "giant fish" stories they can, but instead of the stories getting bigger and bigger, they get smaller and more sensitive.
15. A game where a camera takes footage of two people talking about a sensitive issue, and then afterwards both people try to rewind the tape to the most meaningful part for them.
16. A game where you help a T-Rex frusterated with his short arms realize all the things he can do.
17. A version of the 5 w's where players have two buttons, either forward or stop, to move through the possible "why's" of their stress in a map or roguelike fashion.
18. A game where you write an academic article about what is stressing you out.
19. A game where you edit a scientific article about stress to be what you are actually stressed out about, like mad libs.
20. A game that takes place on the front of a fridge, where you use magnets and notepads to write reminders and positve notes to yourself.

## 2.1 August 8 2018 pt. 1
Due to some unfortunate life events, I've both been inspired and hindered from working on these thesis logs for several weeks. First, inspiration: thinking about what remains - what is comforting - after the extraneous elements of our lives, stuff, and everything else fades into the background and we focus on dealing with our stress. Second, the unfortunate: the revelations have come after being hounded by bedbugs in my new apartment. While mild in comparison to what some new homeowners need to face, the experience of throwing out many of one's belongings, of being decentralized from one's living area, is an extremely tense and unpleasant one. So much of our most private identity and habits are tied to where we live and sleep, and holding onto that sense of internal strength has been at times difficult recently in the face of overwhelming emotions and uncertainty about this space. What has been comforting, much I think like what the participants understood and recognized in their works, is the companionship found in a community of friends and loved ones. 

While I am still not sure how I will care for the specific project ideas that were started in the workshops, I want to stay true to what the core design goal of these individual projects are - expression, companionship, growth, comfort. At the same time that I am revisiting the data produced from these sessions, I am thinking about how I will make the design process as transparent as possible on my end. Live streaming work sessions, office hours, and other physical public access options are things that have been considered. However, this will likely also depend on what kind of making ends up happening.
