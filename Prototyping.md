# 1.0 About
The purpose of this research is to investigate the merits of using a participatory (more than one designer-based) methodology in the making of an original Reflective Game Design; an approach to game making that has the goal to design, deconstruct, and make sense of play experiences. My specific thematic interest is to generate reflection (or the educational reconsideration of some topic) through games around the ways and spaces that stress takes hold in our lives. During a series of three workshops I aim to foster a creative space for storytelling around stress and coping through the co-design and creation of analog (non-digital) game prototypes. Later, I will work to combine this collective information into a digital game prototype.
