## 2.2 August 8 2018 pt. 2
Inspired by all the student brainstorming happening at critical hit, I'm going to try and come up with <s>100</s> <s>50</s> 20 game ideas by the end of this week. Some are likely to be only loosely described. However, I am aiming to commonly keep them be about <b>reflection on stress and coping</b>.

1. A gift giving game where players give "gifts" (empty boxes) to each other with prompts inside that ask each other what they can really give the other person.
2. A safety blanket making game where people sew in items, patches, or other items into blanket pouches to make a useable and "real-life" gamebed.
3. A reverse the clock game where people spin back a giant watch hour by hour, 24 times, to review the day's stresses and comforts.
4. A game where two people make a doll house and write associations on the furniture and people inside, trying to each come up with comparable words between their respective houses.
5. An image making game where people have to make a tile mosaic of the other person's portrait, but only with pieces that get whispered a piece of wisdom from the other player first.
6. An rpg where you help a sad ghost.
7. An alchemy game where one player tries to transmute the other's stress into base stressor elements.
8. A game that uses a pond, stones, and coins to make a stress wishing well - except wishing stress away, you wish for one positive thing you would believe for yourself.
9. A game where you help the kittens who lost their mittens to cope with that loss. 
10. A game where you make a misfit toy.
11. A game of miniature un-twister where you massage out the knots in the wooden mannequin's stressed out backs.
12. A game where one person puts pins in the Pincushion of Stressâ„¢ and another person pulls them out.
13. A game where closing your eyes in real life stops the gameplay, so you can take a break to reflect if you want.
14. A game about two retired adventurers who are recounting all of the "giant fish" stories they can, but instead of the stories getting bigger and bigger, they get smaller and more sensitive.
15. A game where a camera takes footage of two people talking about a sensitive issue, and then afterwards both people try to rewind the tape to the most meaningful part for them.
16. A game where you help a T-Rex frusterated with his short arms realize all the things he can do.
17. A version of the 5 w's where players have two buttons, either forward or stop, to move through the possible "why's" of their stress in a map or roguelike fashion.
18. A game where you write an academic article about what is stressing you out.
19. A game where you edit a scientific article about stress to be what you are actually stressed out about, like mad libs.
20. A game that takes place on the front of a fridge, where you use magnets and notepads to write reminders and positve notes to yourself.

## 2.1 August 8 2018 pt. 1
Due to some unfortunate life events, I've both been inspired and hindered from working on these thesis logs for several weeks. First, inspiration: thinking about what remains - what is comforting - after the extraneous elements of our lives, stuff, and everything else fades into the background and we focus on dealing with our stress. Second, the unfortunate: the revelations have come after being hounded by bedbugs in my new apartment. While mild in comparison to what some new homeowners need to face, the experience of throwing out many of one's belongings, of being decentralized from one's living area, is an extremely tense and unpleasant one. So much of our most private identity and habits are tied to where we live and sleep, and holding onto that sense of internal strength has been at times difficult recently in the face of overwhelming emotions and uncertainty about this space. What has been comforting, much I think like what the participants understood and recognized in their works, is the companionship found in a community of friends and loved ones. 

While I am still not sure how I will care for the specific project ideas that were started in the workshops, I want to stay true to what the core design goal of these individual projects are - expression, companionship, growth, comfort. At the same time that I am revisiting the data produced from these sessions, I am thinking about how I will make the design process as transparent as possible on my end. Live streaming work sessions, office hours, and other physical public access options are things that have been considered. However, this will likely also depend on what kind of making ends up happening.
